This is a sample of map design. Based on the Polish National Cancer
Registry data. It represents risk distribution of lung cancer in
polish counties. The choropleth map as well as the data were processed
in CRAN R  with help of the _sp_ package. The illustration was a
final project for my Coursera Geospatial Revolution class, which I
took in summer 2013.
